Commands thinking
Control has target altitude and command queue
User Functions: BurstStart, BurstEnd, AltitudeUp, AltitudeDown, AltitudeSteady, TakePicture, StartVideo, StopVideo, Macro(n)

Command Functions: Queue(time, command, arg1, arg2), 
Burst(start=now, end=10 seconds)
Altitude(start=now, alt/stop)
Picture(start=now, interval=0)
Video(start=now, length=0)
Info(Primary/Secondary)
Cadence(Ground/Flight/Landing/Secondary, interval)

[future]B[dur-secs=10]
[future]Atarget-meters
[future]Mn

Wiring changes:
OLED power and GPS power controlled by CPU
RTC clock hooked to battery

Loop design
Process GPS: (turn on GPS, gather until done, turn off GPS)
Gather thermal data
Gather battery data
Write to logs
if (!recursive) Process iridium (turn on iridium, send/receive as needed, calling loop recursively, turn off iridium)
Process LED: (On every odd interval, off during flight)
Process Display: (Off during flight)
Process Console
if (!recursive) Sleep for 10 seconds

Event Queue
<timestamp> Command (BurstStart, BurstEnd, AltitudeCheck, )
